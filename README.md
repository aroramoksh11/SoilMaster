# SoilMaster
Importance of Soil Master process lies in its ability to conserve water, promote healthy plant growth, save time, and be cost-effective. An automated system ensures that plants receive the correct amount of water and eliminates over-watering or under-watering, which can harm the plants. It also helps to reduce water bills, plant loss, and time spent on manual watering.
 
To create Soil Master , you will need hardware such as a soil moisture sensor(TensioMeter), water pump, tubing, and Arduino UNO . The sensor detects moisture levels in the soil and triggers the water pump to turn on when the soil is too dry. The tubing carries the water from the pump to the plants.

The process involves setting up the sensor in the soil and connecting it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller is then programmed to control the water pump and set the watering schedule based on the soil moisture levels. The tubing is connected to the water pump and positioned near the plants to deliver water directly to the roots.

Overall, the automatic soil irrigation process is important for promoting healthy plant growth and conserving water, and can be achieved through a relatively simple hardware setup and programming process.
